# human machine dialogue

This project is a set of grammars and languuage understanding rules put in place to create a conversation agent for a reservation task.

### Instalation 
Optimtalk (https://www.optimtalk.cz/cs/) is the software used for interpretation and management of the dialogue.
Once installed (attention, Windows OS is required), place yourself in the Optimtalk directory in the terminal

### Testing 
To make a reservation via a conversation agent, run the command "ot_vxml_interpreter.exe X/gestion_agenda_v2.vxml.vxml" in the terminal (where X is a pathway to the folder).
